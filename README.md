This is my github blog, based on the [Jekyll Now](http://jekyllnow.com) project. 

Nothing really interesting on this side though!

- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - Thanks to it's creators, contributors and maintainers.
- [SVG icons](https://github.com/neilorangepeel/Free-Social-Icons) - Thanks, Neil Orange Peel. They're beautiful. 
- [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/writing/) - Great Jekyll articles. I used Joel's feed.xml in this repository.
- Design & Code reviews - Thanks to [David Furnes](https://github.com/dfurnes), [Jon Uy](https://github.com/jonuy), [Luke Patton](https://github.com/lkpttn)
